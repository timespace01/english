TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF THE HIMMEL THE HERO

CENTRAL LANDS
THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE HOLYCITY OFSTRAHL

I ALWAYS GET LOST INTHIS FOREST...

AREYOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

WHAT'S WRONG?

NOTHING
I'M LOOKING FOR A HOUSE THAT BELONGS TO A MAN NAMED HEITER.

THEN YOUARE OUR GUEST.

SO YOU'RE STILL ALIVE ,YOU CORRUPT PRIEST.

IT SEEMS DYINGIN ACOOL MANNER ISMORE DIFFICULT THAN I EXPECTED

I BROUGHT A BOTTLE TO PUT ON YOUR GRAVE.DO YOU WANNA HAVE A DRINK?

I QUIT DRINKING

REALLY?
I THINK IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU TO PRETEND TO BE INNOCENT OR ASK THE GODDESSFOR FORGIVENESS
THOUGH.

WHO IS SHE?

HER NAME IS FERN SHE'S A WAR
ORPHAN FROM THE SOUTHERN LANDS.

THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.YOU AREN'T THE TYPE TO HELP OTHERS VOLUNTARILY

THAT'S NOT THE HIMMEL I KNOW.

sO, FRIEREN WHAT BRINGS
YOU HERE?

I WAS JUST ON THE WAY TO THE HOLY CITY TO BUY
SOME THINGS.

I'M TRYING TO INTERACT AS MUCH
AS POSSIBLE WITH THE PEOPLE I MEET ON THE JOURNEY.

BESIDES, IOWE YOU A
LOT, so...

...I CAME TO PAY YOU BACK BEFORE YOU DIE.

THEN I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK

WILL YOU TAKE ON AN APPRENTICE?

FERN HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A MAGE.

COULD YOU TAKE HER WITH YOU ON
YOUR JOURNEY?

SORRY HEITER. ANYTHING BUT THAT.

SHE'D SLOW ME DOWN.

YOU KNOW THE DEATH RATE OF APPRENTICE
MAGESIN REAL
FIGHTS.

I CANNOT LEAD A GIRL ENTRUSTED TO ME BYA FRIEND TO HER DEATH.

I UNDER- STAND. WELL, THEN THERE'S SOME- THING ELSE.

THIS WAS EXCAVATED FROM THE GRAVE OF EWIG THE
SAGE.

THEY SAY THIS GRIMOIRE
CONTAINS LONG-LOST SPELLSOF RESURRECTION
AND
IMMORTALITY

I DON'T BELIEVE SUCH MAGIC EXISTS THOUGH

HT
T
I'D LIKE YOUTO DECIPHER IT AND FIND OUTIFIT'S
TRUE.

COULD I ASK YOU TO DO THAT?
1

IMAGE CIPHERS
HUH? PEOPLE BACK
THEN WERE
REALLY FOND OF THESE.

WELL, GIVE ME FIVE ORSIX YEARS AND I CAN DO
IT.

BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE SPELLS?

I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T AFRAIDOF DEATH

I'M ASKING YOUFOR TWO REASONS.

FIRST BACK
THEN I DIDN'T WANT TO SHOW
YOUMY WEAKNESS
AND SECOND
I'M MORE AFRAID OF DYING NOW.

I'M NOT ASKING FOR IMMORTALITY

ALL I WANT IS A LITTLE MORE TIME.

ALSO,THE SCRIPTURES TELL US TO LIVE A
HEALTHY LIFE.
A LONG LIFEIS EXACTLY THAT, FRIEREN.

YOU CORRUPT PRIEST.

AND... WHILE YOU'RE DECIPHER- ING THE GRIMOIRE...
..COULD YOU JUST TEACH
FERN SOME MAGIC ON THE SIDE?

AS A PRIEST, I AM UNABLE TO DO
So.

WELL, I GUESS I COULD DO THAT MUCH.

THERE YOU ARE.

IT WAS HARD TO LOCATE
YOU.
ARE YOU ALWAYS TRAINING IN THE FOREST?

SO IT WAS HARD EVEN FOR YOU TO FIND ME MISTRESS FRIEREN.
MASTER HEITER ALSO TELLS ME I DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A PRESENCE.

I BELIEVE THAT'S A GREAT THING.

YOU'RE RIGHT.

JUSTASI THOUGHT...I CAN BARELY SENSE THE PRESENCE
OF HER MAGIC.

WHAT A TALENT SHE HAS FOR CONTROLLING HER MANA.

JUST HOW HARD HAS SHE TRAINED...

...AT so YOUNG AN AGE?

MASTER HEITER TOLD ME THAT I'LL BE A FULL- FLEDGED MAGE ONCE I CAN SHOOT THROUGH THAT
BOULDER,

HUH.
HEITER KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

YOU NEED TO-

MY SPELL DISSIPATES BEFOREIT CAN REACH THE ROCK.

so I SEE.

WHAT KIND OF TRAINING WOULD
YOU SUGGEST?

CANI ASKYOU SOMETHING
FIRST?

DO YOU LIKE MAGIC?

SOMEWHAT

IN THAT, WE'RE ALIKE.

LET'S SEE...

FOR LONG- RANGE SPELLS, YOUNEED TO COMBINE THREE
ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS THAT EVERY MAGE
NEEDS TO KNOW,AND.

IS FERN'S TRAINING GOING WELL?

IN FOUR YEARS SHE HAS LEARNED THINGS
THAT WOULD TAKE TEN YEARS FOR AN AVERAGE
MAGE.

SHE'S TOO DRIVEN. IT'S NOT AGOOD THING.

SHE'S BEEN
ISOLATING HERSELF IN THE FOREST TO TRAIN.

THAT'S HOW MUCH SHE LOVES
MAGIC.

EVEN SOSHE'S FARFROM
BEINC A FULL- FLEDGED MAGE.

DECIPHERING
THIS GRIMOIRE WILL TAKE LESS TIME

I SEE.

HEY HEITER THIS GRIMOIRE PROBABLY.

HEITER?

PLEASE DON'T LOOKSO WORRIED.
IT'SA MIRACLE THAT I WAS EVEN ABLE TO MOVE AROUND AND LIVE NORMALLY UNTIL NOW.

I'LL HURRY UP WITH
DECIPHERING
THE GRIMOIRE.

THANK YOU.

FERN,I'M CALLING OFFYOUR TRAINING.
HEITER COLLAPSED

7
GO STAY BY HIS SIDE.

I HAVEN'T SHOT THROUGH
THE BOULDER
YET.

THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN DEFINITELY ACHIEVE EVENTUALLY

BUT RIGHT NOW-

IT CANNOT
BE "EVENTU- ALLY"

EVENTU- ALLY...
...HE WILL PASS AWAY.

HE SAVED MY LIFE.

I
THINK IT'D BE SUCH A WASTE FOR YOU TO DIE
NOW.

"A WASTE"...?

IT'S BEEN A WHILE BUT I ONCELOST
SOMEONE ICARED ABOUT
TOO.

UNLIKE MEHIS HEART WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

HEWAS THE KIND OFPERSON WHO WOULD NEVER LEAVE
BEHIND SOMEONE IN'NEED

MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED...

...IF HE HAD LIVED ON INSTEAD OFME.

I WASN'T LIKE HIM SO I WAS GOING TO LIVE THE RESTOF MYLIFE QUIETLY
BUT...

...ONEDAY I REALIZED SOMETHING.

IFI WERE TO DIE...

I WAS AFRAID THAT THE THINGS I LEARNED FROM HIM-COURAGE DETERMINATION FRIENDSHIP..

ALL THOSE PRECIOUS MEMORIES WOULD DISAPPEAR FROM THE WORLD.

SOIF YOUALSO HAVEA PRECIOUS MEMORY LIVING INSIDE
YOU...

..I THINK IT WOULD BE WASTED
IF YOU WERE TO
DIE.

MASTER HEITER
HAS ALWAYS FEARED DYING AND LEAVING
ME ALONE.

HE HAS DONE THE RIGHT THING.

I DON'T WANT HIM TO REGRET SAVING
ME.

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER
I'MA MAGE OR
NOT.

LEARNINC HOW TO SURVIVE ON MY OWN
WILL BE THE WAY I RETURN HIS KINDNESS.

"SHE WAS WORTH SAVING,"
AND "SHE'LL BE JUST FINE ON HER
OWN."
+
THAT'S WHAT I WANT HIM TO FEEL.

YOU REMEMBER EVERYTHING I TAUGHT YOU,RIGHT

YES.

THEN DO AS YOU WISH.

THERE WAS NOTHING IN THERE
ABOUT SPELLS...
..FOR RESURREC- TION OR
IMMOR- TALITY.

I SEE

DID YOU KNOW?

THE FEAR OFDEATHIS UNFATHOM-
ABLE.
IF SUCH SPELLS EXISTED EWIG HIMSELF WOULD HAVE USED
THEM.

THEN WHY-

HOW HAS FERN TURNED OUT?

SHE'S
STILL ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES,BUT SHE CAN BE CONSIDERED
AFULL- FLEDGED MAGE NOW.

IS THAT SO? SO SHE MADE IT IN TIME.

THAT MEANS SHE WON'T SLOW YOU DOWN THEN. AM I RIGHT FRIEREN?

SORRY, HEITER ANYTHING BUT THAT.

SHE'D SLOW ME DOWN.

...YOU TRICKED
ME, HEITER.

HA HA
HA...

YOUR PAYMENT
FOR DECIPHER- ING THE GRIMOIRE IS IN THE
DESK DRAWER.
PLEASE LEAVE THIS PLACE WITH HER BY TONIGHT

WHY?

I
AS YOU CAN SEEI WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER.

IDON'T WANT HER TO GO
THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF LOSINC
SOMEONE AGAIN.

FRIEREN PLEASE LOOK AFTER FERN.

ARE YOU TRYING TO ACT COOL AGAIN, HEITER?

FERNIS ALREADY READY TO SAY GOOD-
BYE.

WHAT YOU SHOULD
DO BEFORE
YOU DIE...

...IS GIVE HER APROPER FAREWELL..

...ANDMAKE AS MANY MEMORIES WITH HER AS POSSIBLE.

FRIEREN
YOU TRULY ARE A KIND GIRL.

HEY...

WHY DID YOU SAVE FERN?

BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HIMMEL THE HERO WOULD'VE DONE.

YESHE WOULD'VE

THEN I SUPPOSE...

..I'LL DO THE SAME.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANKS TO YOU, I WAS ABLE TO REPAY
HIM.

HE JUST OUT- SMARTED ME, THAT'S
ALL.

THIS CORRUPT PRIEST.

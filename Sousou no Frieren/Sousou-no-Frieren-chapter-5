TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE DEATHOF HIMMEL THE HERO

CENTRAL LANDS GROBE FOREST

LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GETTING USED TO
USING DEFENSIVE MAGIC.

NOW LET'S TRY SOMETHINC
MORE ADVANCED

I AIMED WHERE YOU ARE DEFENSE
LESS.

INA REAL FIGHT, YOU'D BE DEAD.

HOW WOULD YOU DEAL
WITH THIS?

I'D DO THIS.

I SEE.

PANT PANT PANT

THAT'S ENOUGH
FOR TODAY.

DEFENSIVE MAGIC IS POWERFUL, BUT IT BURNS
ALOT OF MANA.
YOU'LL EXHAUST YOUR MANA IN ZO TO 3O SECONDS IFYOUTRY
TO KEEP COVERING A WIDE AREA.

THAT MEANS I SHOULD COVER ONLY THE TARGETED POINTS RIGHT BEFORE BEING HIT.

THAT'S RIGHT.

WE'VE BEEN
PRACTICING NOTHING BUT DEFENSIVE
MAGIC.

S
THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S DIRECTLY LINKED TO OUR SURVIVAL

THAT'S TRUE.YOU CAN BLOCK ALMOST ANY OFFENSIVE SPELL BY KNOWING A SINGLE DEFENSIVE
SPELL.

IT'S ALMOST STRANGE
HOW POWERFUL
ITIS.

FERN..
...YOU HAVEN'T READ THE
BOOK I LENT YOUABOUT THE HISTORY OF MAGIC, HAVE YOU?

MAGIC ISN'T ONLY
ABOUT ACTUALLY USING IT.

I STILL HAVE TO READIT TO YOU
BEFORE
BED, HUH?

THE ELDER SAGE OF
CORRUPTION-
QUAL.

A DEMON
THAT COMMITTED UNCOUNT"
ABLE ATROCITIES IN'THIS LAND BO.YEARS AGO
HIMMEL THE HERO'S PARTY SEALED HIM AWAY FORUS

I CAME HERE TO ELIMINATE HIM BECAUSE THE SEAL WILL BREAK
SOON..

BUT REALLY HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS?
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE

UNTIL ABOUT3O YEARSAGO
HIMMEL THE HERO USED TO VISIT THIS VILLAGE ALMOST
EVERY YEAR.

HE TOLD MEIT WAS TO CHECK IN ON THE STATE OF THE SEAL.

HIS GOOD NATURE NEVER CHANGED

YOU ARE NOT SO HEART- LESS THAT YOU'D LET
THE VILLAGE PERISH

HE SAID YOU'D COME BACK BEFORE THE SEAL BROKE DOWN.

THOSE WERE
HIS WORDS.

IS THAT SO?

I CAN SEEIT'S GETTINC PRETTY UNSTABLE

I'LL BREAK THE SEALAND TAKE CARE OF QUAL TOMORROW

YOU SEALED QUAL AWAY, RIGHT?

WAS THEREA REASON
FOR THAT?

HE WAS SIMPLY TOO STRONG.

WE COULDN'T DEFEAT
HIM.

EVEN AMONC THE DEMON KING'S ARMY QUAL WAS AN ESPECIALLY
STRONG IMAGE.

HE CREATED
THE KILLING MAGIC CALLED
"ZOLTRAAK"
...

...THE VERY FIRST PIERCING SPELLIN HISTORY

IT COULD EASILY PIERCE THROUGH ANY HUMAN DEFENSIVE
MAGIC AND EVEN EQUIPMENT WITH MAGIC
RESIS- TANCE..

TO
DIRECTLY DESTROYA PERSON'S
BODY.

THEY SAY THAT IN THIS REGION...

40
PERCENT OF THE
ADVENTURERS
AND 7O PERCENT OF THE MAGES..

...WERE TAKEN OUT BY KILLING MAGIC.

THAT'S JUST TOO POWERFUL.

RIGHT, IT WAS TOO POWER FUL.

MUCH TOO POWER FUL.

AND THAT'S WHY THAT POWER BACKFIRED
ON HIM.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

YOU REALLY HAVEN'T READ THE HISTORY
OF MAGIC, HAVE YOU?
A

SHALL I READIT TO YOU AFTER ALL?

I'LL READ IT NOW.

NO, NEVER MIND IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
TO GET ENOUGH SLEEP

YOU'LL UNDERSTAND TOMORROW
ANYWAY.

I'M BREAK
ING THE SEAL NOW.

DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, FRIEREN

HOW MANY YEARS HAVE PASSED
?

EIGHTY.

ONLY 801 HUH?

TO US, YES.

AND THE DEMON KING?

WE KILLED HIM.

I SEE.
THEN I SHALL AVENGE HIM.

FERN, PUT THE DEFENSIVE SPELL IN FRONT.

ZOL- Traak!

HM WHAT ASUR- PRISE.
YOU MANAGED TO BLOCK
MY KILLING MAGIC

IT MUST BE QUITE AN ADVANCED DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUE.

FRIEREN, WHAT'S GOING ON...?
THAT WAS ORDINARY OFFENSIVE MAGIC.

THAT IS THE KILLING MAGIC.

QUAL, YOUR MAGIC WAS TOO STRONG.

AFTERYOU WERE SEALED AWAY EVERY MAGE FROM
ACROSS
THE CONTINENT GATHERED TO
STUDY AND ANALYZE YOUR KILLING
MAGIC.

IN JUST A FEW YEARS KILLING MAGIC BECAME A PART OF HUMANITY'S
MAGIC KNOWLEDGE.
THEY DEVELOPED POWERFUL DEFENSIVE SPELLS USING THEIR NEW TECHNIQUES

THE MAGIC RESISTANCE OF EQUIPMENT
HAS ALSO IMPROVED REMARKABLY

IT NOW STOPS THE
KILLING MAGIC FROM KILLING PEOPLE.

NOWADAYS
YOUR "KILLING MAGIC" IS JUST ORDINARY OFFENSIVE
MAGIC.

APPARENTLY BOYEARS ISA PRETTY
LONG TIME FOR HUMANS.

QUAL...
...I'LL GIVE YOU A QUICK AND EASY DEATH IF YOU COOPER-
ATE.

I SEE.

I SEE NOW.
IT WORKSBY ALIGNING
ITSELF WITH THE DEFENSIVE MAGIC AND DISPERSING
THE POWER.

WHAT A COMPLEX TECHNIQUE

IT MUST EAT UP A LOT OF YOUR MANA.

HE NOTICED THE WEAKNESS OF THE DEFENSIVE SPELL.

FERN..

...YOU CAN HANDLE THAT, RIGHT?

YES.

I HAVE ALREADY
SEEN THIS IN TRAINING

THEN COVER ME TOO.

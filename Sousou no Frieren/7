THEY WERE YOUR FAMILY...?

IT'S AN OLD STORY.

MY VILLAGE
WAS ATTACKED
By DEMONS

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I'M PRAYING

YOU RETURN
TO NOTHING WHEN YOUDIE

WE GO TO HEAVEN.

UNTIL A FEW THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE COMMONLY HELD BELIEF
WAS THAT WE RETURN TO NOTHING WHEN WE
DIE.

DWARVES VALUE THEIR TRADI- TIONS.

WELLI'M SKEPTICAL ABOUT HEAVEN
TOO.

WITH OUR CURRENT MAGIC TECHNIQUES WE CANNOT OBSERVE SOULS AFTER DEATHSO
WE CAN'T PROVE THEIR EXISTENCE.

I DON'T MIND EITHER WAY THOUGH.

I AGREE.
I ALSO DON'T CAREIF HEAVEN EXISTS OR NOT.

PRIESTS SHOULDN'T SAY THAT
YOU CORRUPT PRIEST.

BUT EVEN IFIT DOESN'T EXIST...
1
THINK IT'S SOMETHING
THAT SHOULD

WHY?

IT'S MORE
CONVENIENT THAT WAY.

THE FINAL DESTINATION FOR THOSE WHO KEPT ON LIVING DESPITEALL
OFLIFE'S HARDSHIPS SHOULDN'T
BE OBLIVION.

WOULDN'T IT BENICER TO THINK THAT THEY'RE INDULGING IN LUXURYUPIN
HEAVEN?

HEH HEH...

YOU'RE RIGHT. ITIS MORE CONVE- NIENT.

SHALL WE PRAY THEN?

YEAH

TWENTY- EIGHT YEARS AFTER THE DEATHOF HIMMEL THE HERO
CENTRAL LANDS BREDT REGION

YOU LOOK.

YOU'RE TOO INDIF- FERENT.

WITH?

THE VOLL BASIN, HUH? HOW NOSTALGIC.

YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE?

A LONG TIME AGO

SHE JUST SAID "A LONG
TIME AGO".. HOW LONG AGO
t
COULD THAT BE?

PERHAPS THE PRE- HISTORIC AGE...

I'M NOT THAT ANCIENT...
A

SO,YOU SAID YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

THE GREAT MAGE FLAMME'S NOTES.
I

WELL, SURE.

BUT YOU KNOW
MOST WORKS BY FLAMME
ARE FAKES.

HEITER COMPILED FLAMME'S
RECORDS THAT WERE LEFT IN THE HOLY CITY AND DETERMINED THAT THIS IS THE
LOCATION

HERREAL NOTES SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THE VOLL
BASINK

FRIEREN, I'M SURE YOU KNOW ABOUTIT.

THAT CORRUPT PRIEST... I DIDN'T REALIZE HE LOOKED INTOIT THAT FAR

ALL RIGHT.

LET'S START BY FINDING
A BIG TREE.

ABIG TREE,
HUH? THIS COULD
TAKE FOREVER

WELL,I SUPPOSE WE HAVEALL THE TIME INTHE
WORLD.

YEAH.

BUT FERN WOULDN'T LIKE ITSO WE SHOULD GET IT DONE
QUICKLY.

LET'S TRY SEARCHING AS EFFICIENTLY AS
POSSIBLE.

YOU'VE CHANGED

YOU NEVER CARED ABOUT OTHERS'
TIME BEFORE

YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SCARY FERNGETS WHEN SHE'S
ANGRY.

ISEE I'LL BE CAREFUL THEN.

MISTRESS FRIEREN I LOCATED A GREAT TREE GROWING OVER SOME
RUINS TO THE WEST

OKAY.

HEY SO,WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO LOOK FOR FLAMME'S NOTES?

PITY.

I FELT PITY FOR YOU AND HIMMEL:

ON
THAT DAY 3O YEARSAGO, YOU SAID YOU REGRETTED NOT TRYING TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT HIM.

YOU SHOULD CONVEY THOSE WORDS TO HIM DIRECTLY.

IT'S SAID THAT IN THE GREAT MAGE FLAMME'S
NOTES, THERE'S A RECORD OF HER CONVERSING
WITH THE DEAD.

THAT'S JUST SOME FAIRY TALE.

AND I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT SEEING
HIM NOW.

ALL MAGIC STARTED OFFAS A FAIRY TALE.

BESIDES DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HIMMEL?

T
THAT'S WHY I ASKED HEITER FOR ADVICE.

LL
I WANTED TO HELP YOU BECAUSE I WAS SURE
YOU'RE REGRETTING
THINGS.

MISTRESS FRIEREN,BOTH THE GREAT TREE AND THE
RUINS ARE PROTECTED BY APOWERFUL
BARRIER...

IT'S BEEN OVER ATHOUSAND YEARS,AND YET MY MASTER STILL HASME WRAPPED
AROUND HER LITTLE FINGER
EH?

THIS HOUSE- SITTER LOOKS UNRELI- ABLE DOESN'T
IT?

THAT AIN'T TRUE.

ONCE THIS GUY GROWSUP
IT'S GONNA KEEP
PROTECTING THIS PLACE FOR A THOUSAND
YEARSOR HOWEVER LONG.

YOU'LL BE DEAD THEN, THOUGH

BUT NOT YOU.

MISTAKE THAT'LL
CHANGE YOUR MINDMAKE

TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AFTER THE DEATHOF HIMMEL THE HERO

CENTRAL LANDS GRANZ CHANNEL

THIS AREA HAS ALWAYS BEEN HARD TO SAIL THROUGH.
A LOT OF THINGS GET WASHED ASHORE

IN THE PAST
EVERYONE
IN THE VILLAGE USED TO MAINTAIN THE COAST TOGETHER,
BUT...

THEY GAVE
UP ONIT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF MAN- POWER, I PRESUME?

THE SEA HERE USED TO BE VERY BEAUTIFUL,
WITH CRYSTAL- CLEAR WATER.

I KNOW.

COULD THIS BE ENOUGH
OFA REWARD?

A BOOK BY THE GREAT MAGE FLAMME, HUH?

MIS- TRESS FRIE- REN.

IS THIS THE ONLY GRIMOIRE YOU HAVE IN THIS VILLAGE?

OKAY.
WE WILL ACCEPT YOUR CLEAN-UP REQUEST.

THAT GRIMOIRE
ISA FAKE, ISN'T IT?

I SEE YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING AS I TOLD
YOU.
I'M PROUD OF YOU FERN.

THERE IS NO REAL BOOK BY FLAMME IN EXISTENCE
THISIS ANOTHER POOR IMITATION.

THEN WHY DID YOU ACCEPT
IT?

BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE HE NEEDS
OUR HELP.

...LADY FRIEREN.

HOW DOES CLEANING
UP THE COASTLINE RELATE TO THE NEW
YEAR'S FESTIVAL?

IT'S THE CUSTOM IN THIS VILLAGE TO WATCH THE SUNRISE ON THE DAY
OF THE FESTIVAL.

APPARENTLY IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL WHEN THE SUNLIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE CRYSTAL- CLEAR SEA.

YOU DIDN'T SEE IT?

DO YOU BELIEVE ICOULD WAKE UP FORIT?

YOU HAVE A POINT.

LET'S HURRY
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

THE WATER QUALITY SEEMS FINE TOO.

WE MANAGED
TO FINISH JUST ONE DAY BEFORE.

IT'S BARELY
RECOGNIZABLE
COMPARED TO WHEN WE STARTED.

TO BE HONEST, I'M NOT
INTERESTED.

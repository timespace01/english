TWENTY- SIXYEARS AFTER HIMMEL
THE HERO'S DEATH

CENTRAL LANDS
TURK REGION

THAT'S ENOUGH FERN.
WE'RE FINISHED

THANK YOUSO MUCH FOR YOUR
HELP.

HERE'S THE REWARD I PROMISED
YOU.

WE'VE BEEN ONLY DOING LOW- PROFILE JOBS.

WHAT
ADVENTURERS REALLYDOIS NOT AS FANCY AS EVERYONE
THINKS.

WHAT WAS THE REWARD?

FOLK MAGIC.
IT SAYS IT'S A SPELL THAT PRODUCES HOT TEA.
LET'S EXPERI- MENT LATER

THE OTHER DAY WE GOT A SPELL THAT REMOVES RUST FROM BRONZE STATUES.

AND BEFORE THATA SPELL THAT TURNS SWEET GRAPES INTO SOUR ONES

A COLLECT-
YOU'RE
INC NOTHING
BUT STRANGE SPELLS.

IT'S WHAT I LIKE.

YOU TRULY LOVE MAGIC DON'T YOU, MISTRESS FRIEREN?
ONLY SOMEWHAT. JUST LIKE YOU,FERN

I FEEL LIKEIT'S A LITTLE DIFFER- ENT...

IT'S THE SAME.

AREYOU SUREIT'S OKAYTO ASKYOUA FAVOR?
I'M JUST AN HERBALIST. I HAVE NO SPELLS TO TEACH
YOU.

I DON'T MIND.
IT'D BE HELPFUL ENOUGH TO LEARN ABOUT THE
FLORA IN THIS REGION

HERE WE ARE.

IS THAT A STATUE
OF HIMMEL THE HERO...?

IT'S IN SUCH TERRIBLE CONDITION. I'MTOO OLD TODO ANYTHING ABOUTIT ON MY OWN.
THE VILLAGERS ARE NO LONGER INTERESTED
IN IT.

WHEN A MONSTER ATTACKED
OUR VILLAGE...
...HIMMEL THE HERO FOUGHT FOR US, RISKING HIS OWN LIFE!AND
YET...

..THISIS HOW WE REPAY HIM... IT'S JUST
UNFAIR.

NOHE BROUGHT
ITON HIMSELF.

IT'S HIS FAULT FOR BEING AN ATTENTION SEEKER.

HE SHOULD HAVE JUST
REFUSED WHEN THE VILLAGERS TOLD HIM ABOUT BUILDING THIS
STATUE

HE DROVE
THE CRAFTSMAN MAD BY SPENDING 18HOURS DECIDING ONA POSE.

Is this okay? I'mworriedIlook too handsome in
m hungry.
this pose
Enough already. Decide now.
ut
-

IN THE END HE JUST SETTLED ON THIS UTTERLY ORDINARY POSE.

YOU'RE QUITE UNIQUE

COMETO THINK OF IT THERE WAS AN ELVEN MAGEIN THE HERO'S
PARTY.

ALL RIGHT, LET'S CLEAN IT UP.

THANK YOu sO MUCH. MAGIC IS TRULY AMAZING.

MOST IMPRESSIVE THERE'S NOT A HINT OF RUST LEFT ON THIS BRONZE
STATUE.

I'D LIKE TO HAVE SOME COLOR AROUND
MAYBE I'LL PLANT FLOWERS LATER.

FRIEREN, YOU CAN USE MAGIC THAT PRODUCES FLOWERS
RIGHT?

YEAH. I WONDER
WHAT FLOWER WOULD BE SUITABLE..

I KNOW. BLUE-MOON
WEED WOULD BE PERFECT

...WHAT KIND OF FLOWER IS THAT?

NO IDEA. I'VE NEVER SEENIT BEFORE.

THEN WHY?

IT'S A FLOWER FROM HIMMEL'S HOMETOWN.

BUT HOW COULD YOU MAKE FLOWERS
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE WITH MAGIC...?

BLUE- MOON WEED.

A
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT NAME IN YEARS

IT USED TO GROW SOMEWHERE DEEP IN THAT
FOREST TOO.

so THERE
ARE NONE AROUND ANYMORE?

IT WENT EXTINCT.NO ONE HAS SEEN BLUE- MOONWEED
ONTHIS CONTINENT FORSEVERAL
DECADES
NOW

IS THAT So?

FERN, WE'RE LEAVING.

...OKAY.

YOU'RE HIDING SOME- THING.
t..
I WON'T GET MAD,BUT SHOW
IT TO ME.
T
y.

SEED RATS. THEY'RE PESTS. VERMIN THAT EAT SEEDS.

I'LL RELEASE THEM IN THE FOREST.

WELL THEN, FERN LET'S GO LOOK FOR BLUE-MOON
WEED.

ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT THIS?
IT USED TO GROW SOMEWHERE DEEPIN THIS FOREST A LITTLE WHILE
AGO-
YOU MEAN SEVERAL DECADES AGO.

BUT IT'S WORTH LOOKING

IF WE FIND AN ACTUAL LIVING ONE AND ANALYZE
IT...

...WECAN ACQUIRE THE MAGIC TO MAKE BLUE-MOON
WEED BLOOM.

ARE YOU DOING THIS FOR MASTER HIMMEL?

NO BELIEVE I'M DOING
IT FOR MYSELE

MISTRESS FRIEREN,IT'S
ALREADY BEEN HALF A YEAR...
.SINCE WE BEGAN LOOKING
FOR
BLUE-MOON
WEED.

YOU'RE RIGHT.
LET'S EXPAND THE RANGE OF OUR SEARCH NOW.

OH MY IT'S RARE TO SEE
YOU ALONE.

IT'S BEEN QUITEA WHILE SINCE YOU TWO CAME TO THE VILLAGE

DID YOU FIND BLUE- MOON WEED?

DO YOU THINK WE CAN?

MISTRESS FRIEREN'S DEDICATION TO MAGIC IS ABNORMAL.

AT THIS RATE, WE'LL
END UP LOOKING FORIT FOR
YEARS OR EVEN DECADES.

MISTRESS FRIEREN HAS THE POWER TO SAVE MANY PEOPLE.

IT'S UNACCEPT- ABLE THAT
SHE'S WASTING
HER TIME ON SOMETHING THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN
EXIST.

YOU'RE
so YOUNG.

AM I WRONG TO THINK THAT?

I DON'T THINK So.

BUT SHE MUST BE THINKING DIFFER- ENTLY.

AND SHE'S MUCH OLDER AND MORE MATURE THAN WE ARE SO...

.I'M
SURE SHE'LL UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEELIFYOU TELL HER HONESTLY.

SHE TOLD ME THESEARE THE SEEDS OFA CLOSELY
RELATED SPECIES THAT WERE STORED TO USE FOR
MEDICINE.

HOW ABOUT WE PLANT THESE
AROUND MASTER HIMMEL'S STATUE INSTEAD...?

I UNDER- STAND, FERN.

SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WORRY

I NEED TO REMEMBER THIS ISN'T
JUST MY TIME ANYMORE.
WE NEED TO WRAP THIS UP.

WE'LL JUST LOOK A LITTLE LONGER THEN WE CAN GIVE
UP.

HOW MANY YEARS WOULD BEA LITTLE LONGER"?

JUSTA LITTLE MORE.

YOU REALLY NEVER GIVE U-

LET'S FOLLOW
IT.

WHAT AREYOU GATHERING
MAGIC FOR?

4
IT'S JUST A HOBBY
OF MINE.

IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT.

IT REALLY
IS JUST A HOBBY.

I USED TO BEMORE APATHETIC AND LAZY BEFORE THOUGH

THERE WAS A FOOL WHO USED TO PRAISE ME FOR THE
MAGIC I ACQUIRED.

THAT'S ALL.

THAT'S RIDICU- LOUS.

I AGREE.

THAT'S

A FLOWER PETAL.

THEY SAY SEED RATS STORE THEIR
FOOD BY BURYING ITIN SAFE PLACES.

SOUNDS LIKE A SMART ANIMAL.

NOT REALLY.

THEY HIDE ITALL OVER THE PLACE...
...So THEY OFTEN FORGET WHERE THEY BURIED
IT.

BLUE- MOON WEED?

IT'SA FLOWER THAT GROWSINMY HOMETOWN. THEY'RE VERY BEAUTIFUL.

WELL, NOTAS BEAUTIFUL AS ME THOUGH.

LET'S GET GOING.

FRIEREN

I'D LIKE TO SHOW THEM TO YOUONE
DAY.

OKAY
WHEN YOU HAVEA CHANCE THEN.

I KNEW THERE WERE SOME LEFT BUT...

...THIS ISMORE THAN I EXPECT-
ED.

SORRY I MADE YOU WAIT HIMMEL.

I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REALLY FOUND THEM...

NOW WE CAN
INITIATE THE SPELL FOR BLUE-MOON
WEED.

WHY ARE YOUSO DEVOTED
TO MAGIC...?

I CANNOT COMPRE- HEND IT.

I KNOW YOU CAN.

YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP ON...

BECOMING AMAGE EITHER.

THAT'S DIFFERENT.

IJUST NEEDED TO GAIN THE STRENGTH TO SURVIVE ON MY OWN. IT DIDN'T
MATTER HOW.

IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE MAGIC...

AND YET MAGIC IS WHAT YOU CHOSE.

YES, IT WAS.

I NEVER IMAGINED I WOULD SEE THE FLOWERS OF THE
BLUE- MOON WEED AGAIN.
THEY ARE TRULY BEAUTI- FUL.

THANK YOU, FRIEREN.
NOW I'M SURE THE STATUE WILL NOT BEFOR- GOTTEN.

OHI ALMOST FORGOT.

THERE,
OH MY HOW LOVELY.

WELL THEN. SHALL WE GO?
